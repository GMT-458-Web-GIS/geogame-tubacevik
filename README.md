# GeoGame - World Capitals Quiz üåç

GeoGame is an interactive educational game designed to help users learn world capitals through a fun and engaging map-based quiz. Players are presented with the name of a capital city, and their task is to identify the country it belongs to from four multiple-choice options. Points are awarded for each correct answer, and a final score determines the player's success at the end of the game.

## How to Play

- **Question Timer**: Each question has a countdown timer (e.g., 10 seconds) displayed on the screen. Players must select an answer before the time runs out.  
  - If the player selects the correct answer within the time limit, they earn 10 points, and the location is marked with a star icon on the map.
  - If the player does not answer within the allotted time, the question is considered incorrect, no points are awarded, and the game automatically proceeds to the next question.

- **Game Timer**: The game has a total timer (e.g., 120 seconds) which limits the overall playtime. This timer counts down throughout the game.  
  - If the game timer reaches zero before all questions are answered, the game ends immediately, and the player's final score is displayed.

- **End of Game**: Once all questions have been answered or the total game time runs out, the final score is displayed with a success or failure message:  
  - If the score is above average, a success message appears: "Congratulations, You Earned Points: [Score]".
  - If the score is below average, a failure message appears: "Game Over!! Score: [Score]".

This structure provides a time-based challenge, encouraging players to answer both quickly and accurately. The combination of question and game timers keeps the game fast-paced and engaging.
