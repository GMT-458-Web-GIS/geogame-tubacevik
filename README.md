# GeoGame - World Capitals Quiz üåç

GeoGame is an interactive educational game designed to help users learn world capitals through a fun and engaging map-based quiz. Players are presented with the name of a capital city, and their task is to identify the country it belongs to from four multiple-choice options. Points are awarded for each correct answer, and a final score determines the player's success at the end of the game.

## How to Play

- **Question Timer**: Each question has a countdown timer (e.g., 10 seconds) displayed on the screen. Players must select an answer before the time runs out.  
  - If the player selects the correct answer within the time limit, they earn 10 points, and the location is marked with a star icon on the map.
  - If the player does not answer within the allotted time, the question is considered incorrect, no points are awarded, and the game automatically proceeds to the next question.

- **Game Timer**: The game has a total timer (e.g., 120 seconds) which limits the overall playtime. This timer counts down throughout the game.  
  - If the game timer reaches zero before all questions are answered, the game ends immediately, and the player's final score is displayed.

- **End of Game**: Once all questions have been answered or the total game time runs out, the final score is displayed with a success or failure message:  
  - If the score is above average, a success message appears: "Congratulations, You Earned Points: [Score]".
  - If the score is below average, a failure message appears: "Game Over!! Score: [Score]".

This structure provides a time-based challenge, encouraging players to answer both quickly and accurately. The combination of question and game timers keeps the game fast-paced and engaging.

## Project Description and Purpose

GeoGame is designed to enhance users' geographical knowledge of world capitals through an interactive and timed map-based quiz. The game combines visual elements on a world map with a quiz format, making learning fun and engaging for players of all ages.

## Requirements

### User Requirements

- Players should see marked capitals and countries on the map.
- Players should be able to answer multiple-choice questions about capitals or countries.
- Players receive feedback on whether their answers are correct or incorrect.
- A score and a success/failure message are displayed at the end of the game.

### Technical Requirements

- **Leaflet.js**: Used for map functionalities, such as displaying markers and providing interactive map features.
- **D3.js**: Utilized to create visual animations that provide feedback for correct answers.
- Compatibility with modern web browsers.
- A geo-component, such as map interactions or geographical data visualization, is essential.

### Hardware Requirements

- A web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge).
- Internet connection (to load map data).

## Technologies Used

The project utilizes the following libraries and technologies:

- **HTML**: Provides the structure of the web page.
- **CSS**: Defines the visual styling and layout of the game interface.
- **JavaScript**: Manages game logic and user interactions.
- **Leaflet.js**: Provides interactive map functionality, enabling map navigation and marker placement.
- **D3.js**: Adds animations and graphical feedback when a correct answer is selected.

## Game Flow and Interactions

- **Question Display**: The game presents a question about a randomly selected capital city and four multiple-choice answers.
- **Answer Selection**: The player selects one of the options.
- **Feedback and Scoring**:

  - **Question Timer**: Each question has a countdown timer (e.g., 10 seconds). If the player does not answer in time, the question is considered incorrect.
  - **Game Timer**: The game has a total time limit (e.g., 120 seconds). When the game timer reaches zero, the game ends.
- **End of Game**: When all questions are answered or the game timer runs out, the game displays the final score with a success or failure message based on the score.

## Design and UI

- **Map Area**: The main map area, powered by Leaflet.js, displays markers and allows players to interact with the quiz questions.
- **Question Box**: Positioned next to the map, the question box shows the current question, answer options, and score.
- **Timers**:  
  - **Game Timer**: Displays the remaining total game time at the top of the game area.
  - **Question Timer**: Shows the remaining time for the current question just below the question text.
