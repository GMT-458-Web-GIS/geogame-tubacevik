GeoGame - World Capitals Quiz üåç
GeoGame is an interactive educational game designed to help users learn world capitals through a fun and engaging map-based quiz. Players are presented with the name of a capital city, and their task is to identify the country it belongs to from four multiple-choice options. Points are awarded for each correct answer, and a final score determines the player's success at the end of the game.

How to Play
Question Timer: Each question has a countdown timer (e.g., 10 seconds) displayed on the screen. Players must select an answer before the time runs out.
If the player selects the correct answer within the time limit, they earn 10 points, and the location is marked with a star icon on the map.
If the player does not answer within the allotted time, the question is considered incorrect, no points are awarded, and the game automatically proceeds to the next question.
Game Timer: The game has a total timer (e.g., 120 seconds) which limits the overall playtime. This timer counts down throughout the game.
If the game timer reaches zero before all questions are answered, the game ends immediately, and the player's final score is displayed.
End of Game: Once all questions have been answered or the total game time runs out, the final score is displayed with a success or failure message:
If the score is above average, a success message appears: "Congratulations, You Earned Points: [Score]".
If the score is below average, a failure message appears: "Game Over!! Score: [Score]".
This structure provides a time-based challenge, encouraging players to answer both quickly and accurately. The combination of question and game timers keeps the game fast-paced and engaging.
